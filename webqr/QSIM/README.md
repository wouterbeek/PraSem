# QSIM

Semantic Web implementation of QSIM.

## Features

The algorithm is a classic one, but the innovations are the following:
  * RDF(S) is used for representing QR models as well as
    the simulation results, i.e., the behavior graphs.
    Note that this allows the behavioral descrion of SW resources.
  * The QR models and behavior graphs can be visualized using SVG.
    GraphViz is used for the layout.
  * The SVGs are embedded in a Web page.
