/** <module> RFC 1738

Specifies the syntax and semantics for localizing and accessing resources
via the Internet (URLs).

# General URL form

~~~{.txt}
<url> = <scheme>:<scheme-specific-part>
~~~

The former part is the name of the scheme used.

The latter part is interpreted relative to the scheme used.

# Encoding of URLs

  1. Character sequences in parts of a URL represent sequences of octets.
     The mapping uses the US-ASCII code character set.
  1. Octets may be encoded by a character triplet consisting
     of the character "%" followed by the two hexadecimal digits.
  1. Safe characters: uppercase and lowercase letters, decimal digits,
     and =|$-_.*!*'(),|=.
  1. Letters are interpreted case-insensitively.

Octets that must be encoded using %-escaping:
  1. Octets with no corresponding graphic: 80-ff (unused) and
     00-1f, 7f (control).
  1. *|Unsafe characters|*:
     * _Spaces_
       Transcribing/typesetting URLs may remove/add spaces.
     * Characters =|<>|=
       URL delimiters in free text.
     * _|Double quote mark|_
       URL delimiter in free text.
     * _|Hash character|_
       URL fragment delimiter
     * _|Percent sign|_
       Used for character encoding.
     * Characters =|{}|\^~[]`|=,
       Characters that are sometimes modified by gateways and other
       transport agents.
  1. *|Reserved characters|* that may have a special meaning according to a
     scheme: =|;/?:@=&|= (this is a closed collection).

# Scheme-specific syntax

URL schemes that involve the direct use of an IP-based protocol to a
specified host on the Internet use a common syntax for the scheme-specific
data (=|[]|= means optional part):

~~~{.txt}
<scheme-specific-part> = //[<user>[:<password>]@]<host>[:<port>][/<url-path>]
~~~

## Host

  * Fully qualified domain name of a network host.
    Dot-separated sequence of domain labels, starting and ending with an
    alphanumeric character, possibly containing dashes, the rightmost
    domain label does not start with a digit.
  * IP address of a network host.
    Four dot-separated decimal digit groups.

# Schemes

## FTP

Default password: the Internet e-mail address of the end user. [???]
Default port: 21.
Default user: anonymous.

~~~{.txt}
<url-path> = <cwd1>/<cwd2>/.../<cwdN>/<name>[;type=<typecode>]
~~~

CWD (Change Working Directory) commands <cwdi>

<typecode> is one of:
  * =a=
    TYPE command with argument =a=.
  * =d=
    NLST (name list) command with argument =|<name>|=, returning a file
    directory listing.
  * =i=
    TYPE command with argument =i=.

<cwdi> and <name> are (possibly encoded) strings with '/' and ';' encoded.

### Examples

~~~{.txt}
ftp://myname@host.dom/%2Fetc/motd
"CWD /etc", "RETR motd"
~~~

~~~{.txt}
ftp://myname@host.dom//etc/motd
"CWD ", "CWD etc", "RETR motd"
~~~

## HTTP

~~~{.txt}
<url> = http://<host>[:<port>]/[<path>][?][<searchpart>]
~~~

  * Default port: 80.
  * No user name, no password.
  * =|<path>|= is a HTTP selector.
  * =|<searchpart>|= is a query string.
  * If =|<path>|= and =|<searchpart>|= are both omitted, then the last '/'
    may be omitted as well.
  * '/' _may_ be used to designate a hierarchical structure.
  * Reserved chaarcters in =|<path>|= and =|<searchpart>|=: =|/;?|=

## GOPHER

~~~{.txt}
<url> = gopher://<host>[:<port>]/[<gopher-path>]
~~~

=|<gopher-path>|= is one of:
  * =|<gophertype>[<selector>]|=
  * =|<gophertype>[<selector>]%09<search>|=
  * =|<gophertype>[<selector>]%09[<search>]%09<gopher+_string>|=

  * Default port: 70.
  * =|<gophertype>|= is a single-character field.
  * Default =|<gophertype>|=: 1.
  * =|<selector>|= is a sequence of octets, excluding 09 (horizontal tab),
    0A (line feed), 0D (carriage return).
  * If =|<gopher-path>|= is missing, then the last '/' is optional.
  * The empty =|<selector>|= refers to the top-level directory.
  * =|%09|= is an encoded horizontal tab.

@tbd

## MAILTO

~~~{.txt}
<url> = mailto:<rfc822-addr-spec>
~~~

"Unlike many URLs, the mailto scheme does not represent a data object
to be accessed directly; there is no sense in which it designates an object.
It has a different use than the message/external-body type in MIME." [???]

## NEWS

~~~{.txt}
<url> = news:<newsgroup-name>
<url> = news:<message-id>
~~~

  * =|<newsgroup-name> is a period-delimited hierarchical name.
  * =|<newsgroup-name> = *|= refers to all available news groups.
  * =@= is a reserved character in =|<newsgroup-name>|= and =|<message-id>|=.

~~~{.txt}
<message-id> = <unique>@<full_domain_name>
~~~

"The news URLs are unusual in that by themselves, they do not contain
sufficient information to locate a single resource, but, rather, are
location-independent." [???]

## NNTP

~~~{.txt}
<url> = nntp://<host>[:<port>]/<newsgroup-name>/<article-number>
~~~

  * Default port: 119.

## TELNET

Designates a service, not a data object.

~~~{.txt}
<url> = telnet://[<user>[:<password>]]@<host>[:<port>]/
~~~

  * If =|<port>|= is omitted, then the last '/' may be omitted.
  * Default port: 23.

## WAIS

Designate a WAIS database:
~~~{.txt}
<url> = wais://<host>[:<port>]/<database>
~~~

Designates a particular search:
~~~{.txt}
<url> = wais://<host>[:<port>]/<database>?<search>
~~~

Designates a particular document:
~~~{.txt}
<url> = wais://<host>[:<port>]/<database>/<wtype>/<wpath>
~~~

  * Default port: 210.

# FILES

Designate files accessible on a particular host computer, i.e. _not_
universally accessible files.

~~~{.txt}
<url> = file://[<host>/]<path>
~~~

  * =|<host>|= is a fully qualified domain name or =localhost=.
  * Default host: =localhost=.
  * =|<path>|= is a hierarchical directory path
    =|<directory>/<directory>/.../<name>|=.

## PROSPERO

~~~{.txt}
<url> = prospero://<host>[:<port>]/<hsoname>;<field>=<value>
~~~

  * Default port: 1525.

# Registration of new schemes

IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) will maintain a registry
of URL schemes.

The submission of a new scheme must include a definition of an algorithm
for accessing resources and the syntax for representing locations.

  * Prefix =|x-|=
    Reserved for experimental purposes.

## Proposed schemes

  * *afs*
    Andrew File System global file names.
  * *mid*
    Message identifiers for electronic mail.
  * *cid*
    Content identifiers for MIME body parts.
  * *nfs*
    Network File System (NFS) file names.
  * *tn3270*
    Interactive 3270 emulation sessions.
  * *mailserver*
    Access to data available from mail servers.
  * *z39.50*
    Access to ANSI Z39.50 services.

# URLs in context

To distinguish URLs from other data structures (e.g. URI), use prefix
=|URL:|=.

To distinguish URLs from other text (e.g. natural language punctuation),
use enclosing angle brackets along with the prefix =|URL:|=.
  * Whitespace inside the enclosing brackets is ignored.
  * No whitespace should follow a hyphen, since typesetters and printers
    may (erroneously) introduce a hyphen at the end of a line when breaking
    a line.
