\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

As is clear from our evaluation results,
 the partition that is generated by our approach
 is significantly more detailed than
 the partitions that are generated by existing approaches.

The use of MDL in order to find the partition members or ``kinds''
 guarantees that each partition member is indeed well-motivated
 by the data at hand and is not the result of overfitting.

Our approach is largely consistent with the typeset approach
 (column 5 in Table \ref{tab:partitions} showing the mutual information
  between both approaches).
Our approach is completely consistent with the propertyset approach
 (due to Definitions \ref{def:predicate} and \ref{def:fingerprint}).

Moreover, our generic fingerprint is sometimes able to predict
 the typeset slightly better than (and is always at least as good as)
 the propertyset approach.
