# Identity on the Web (IOTW)

Where we investigate the _meaning_ of identity relations in Linked Data
and the Semantic Web.

## Changes in the 2013/08-2013/09 version w.r.t. the 2013/05 version

  * Optimization using association lists implemented by AVL trees
    containing ordered sets.
  * Identity sets i.o. identity pairs.
  * Simple, RDF, and RDFS entailment.
  * Predicate/Object-pair subpartitions are calculated.
  * Literal identity is established in terms of the value space
    (used to be based on the lexical space).
  * Modular rewrite of all IOTW code.
  * GraphViz export was ported to the new DCG-based implementation.
