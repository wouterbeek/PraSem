\section{Extensions}
\label{sec:extensions}

In section \ref{sec:approach} 
  we made some simplifications in order to keep the discussion brief.
We discuss three extensions to our base approach.
The first extension provides further details on how to assess
  identity conditions of typed literals, which may occur in the object
  position of a triple.
The second extension generalizes the notion of a
  predicate, allowing more indiscernibility predicates to be found.
The third extension shows that definitions
  \ref{def:identity_lower_approximation} and
  \ref{def:identity_higher_approximation}
  do not give the most optimal solution in some arcane cases.
