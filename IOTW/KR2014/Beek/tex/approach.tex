\section{Approach}
\label{sec:approach}

First we give a short outline of our approach and then
  we provide a more detailed description of the individual steps.

\subsection{Outline of the approach}

We start by assuming that we are given an identity relation $\approx$.
We will then reinterpret this relation as an indiscernibility relation
  relative to different sets of predicates.
Pairs that have the same indiscernibility predicates
  are simi-discernible, i.e.: they discern resources
  based on the same criteria.
Simi-discernibility is an equivalence relation
  which partitions all pairs and thus also the identity relation $\approx$.
The members of the indiscernibility partition
  have a certain overlap with the original identity relation.
The overlap between an indiscernibility subset and the identity relation
  is called an \emph{identity subrelation}.
Each identity subrelation is characterized in terms of predicates
  from the domain vocabulary.
Different forms of identity can therefore be distinguished
  and meaningfully described.
Based on whether there is a complete or a partial overlap
  between the simi-discernible partition members and
  the identity subrelations,
  these partition members belong either to the lower ($\lowerapprox$)
  or to the higher approximation ($\higherapprox$) of $\approx$.
Besides setting a lower and a higher bound to the identity relation,
  we can also calculate the quality of the identity relation
  and the precision of each identity subrelation.
