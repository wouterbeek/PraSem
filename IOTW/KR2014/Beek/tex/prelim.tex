$G$ denotes an RDF graph. It consists of a set of ground binary
predicates $p(s,o)$, called ``triples'' in SW jargon, and often
written as $\triple{s}{p}{o}$. These triples form a graph with all
subjects $s$ and objects $o$ as nodes, and
each assertion $p(s,o)$ corresponds to a directed edge labelled $p$
between $s$ and $o$.

We identify subsets of RDF terms based on
  their positional occurrence in triples in $G$:
  $S_G$, $P_G$, and $O_G$ denote the subject, predicate and object terms
  in $G$ respectively.

The interpretation $I$ maps RDF terms onto resources,
  and triples onto truth values.
The extension function $Ext$ maps resources onto pairs of resources.
$I(\triple{s}{p}{o})$ is true iff
  $\pair{I(s)}{I(o)} \in Ext(I(p))$.
