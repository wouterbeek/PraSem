# PraSem

This is the codebase for the NWO project PraSem: Pragmatic Semantics for
the Web of Data.

## Modes

You can run this codebase in two modes.

### Developer

This loads SWI-Prolog's debug console and writes debug messages to it.

This keeps the SWI-Prolog console in view, event when SWI-Prolog is not
started from within a terminal emulator.

This loads the code documentation server (using swipl package plDoc).
The documentation front-end is accessed using the `documentation` command
in the Web console.

`developer.pl`

### User

This removes the SWI-Prolog console from sight, if possible. This does not
influence the visibility of the terminal emulater that swipl what started
from.

`run.pl`

## Personal directory `.PraSem`

When PraSem is started for the first time, it creates a directory called
`.PraSem` in the user's home folder (e.g. `/home/wouter/.PraSem`).

This is where PraSem keeps all non-static data.

This personal PraSem directory contains the following subdirectories:

1. `data`
2. `debug`
3. `log`


### The `data` subdirectory

Currently contains the following subdirectories:

1. *ILP* Contains training files used by the relational learner.
2. *Standards* Contains standards that are too big to be part of the PraSem
   codebase, e.g. `lexvo.rdf` for language and country URIs based on
   various ISO standards.
3. *STCN* The _redactiebladen_ that are used by the parser in
   =|DB/STCN/|=.
4. *Wordnet* The Prolog version of the _Wordnet_ lexical corpus.

### The `debug` subdirectory

Currently the contents of the =db= RDF graph are written in RDF/XML
serialization format at the end of each PraSem session.

### The `log` subdirectory

The logging system writes files to this subdirectory. Whenever a
PraSem session ends, a file is created. Since many log files will be created in this fashion, they are subdivided into a file hierarchy:
    
1. The mode in which PraSem was run (either `developer`or `user`).
2. The year (four decimal numbers).
3. The month (two decimal numbers).
4. The day (two decimal numbers).

# plDoc online documentation

If you want to make the dynamic tables visible in the plDoc documentation
server, you need to add the following clause to the `take_block` predicate
in `pldoc/doc_wiki.pl`. This code cannot be included in SWI-Prolog
releases because of the security implications of running arbitrary code on
a server.

    take_block(
      [_-['!', '!', w(Module), '!', '!', w(Predicate), '!', '!', w(Arity0), '!', '!'] | Lines],
      _BaseIndent,
      table([class(wiki)], Rows),
      Lines
    ):-
      atom_number(Arity0, Arity),
      findall(
    tr(Cells),
    (
      length(Vars, Arity),
      Call =.. [Predicate | Vars],
      call(Module:Call),
      findall(
    td([w(Atom)]),
    (
      member(Var, Vars),
      (atomic(Var) -> Atom = Var ; term_to_atom(Var, Atom))
    ),
    Cells
      )
    ),
    Rows
      ).
