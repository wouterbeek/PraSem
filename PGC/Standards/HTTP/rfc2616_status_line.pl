% # Pramatics
%
% HTTP applications are not required to understand the meaning of
%  all registered status codes, though such understanding is
%  obviously desirable.
%
% ## Status code class
%
% However, applications MUST understand the class of any status code,
%  as indicated by the first digit, and treat any unrecognized response
%  as being equivalent to the `x00` status code of that class,
%  with the exception that an unrecognized response MUST NOT be cached.
%
% ### Example
%
% For example, if an unrecognized status code of `431` is received
%  by the client, it can safely assume that there was something wrong with
%  its request and treat the response as if it had received
%  a `400` status code.
% In such cases, user agents SHOULD present to the user
%  the entity returned with the response, since that entity is likely
%  to include human-readable information which will explain
%  the unusual status.

% # Semantics
%
% The `Reason-Phrase` is intended to give a short textual description of
%  the `Status-Code`.
% The first digit of the `Status-Code` defines the class of response.
% The last two digits do not have any categorization role.
% There are 5 values for the first digit:
%   - `1xx`: **Informational**
%     Request received, continuing process.
%   - `2xx`: **Success**
%     The action was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
%   - `3xx`: **Redirection**
%     Further action must be taken in order to complete the request.
%   - `4xx`: **Client Error**
%     The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.
%   - `5xx`: **Server Error**
%     The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.
%
% # Pragmatics
%
% ## Human or machine
%
% The `Status-Code` is intended for use by automata
%  and the `Reason-Phrase` is intended for the human user.
%
% ## Display of reason phrase
%
% The client is not required to examine or display the `Reason-Phrase`.
%
% ## Default values
%
% The individual values of the numeric status codes defined for HTTP/1.1,
%  and an example set of corresponding Reason-Phrase's, are presented below.
% The reason phrases listed here are only recommendations
%  -- they MAY be replaced by local equivalents without affecting
%  the protocol.

% The purpose of the `100` (Continue) status is to allow a client
%  that is sending a request message with a request body to determine
%  if the origin server is willing to accept the request
%  (based on the request headers) before the client sends the request body.
% In some cases, it might either be inappropriate or highly inefficient
%  for the client to send the body if the server will reject the message
%  without looking at the body.
%
% Requirements for HTTP/1.1 clients:
%   - If a client will wait for a `100` (Continue) response before sending
%     the request body, it MUST send an `Expect` request-header field
%     with the `100-continue` expectation.
%   - A client MUST NOT send an `Expect` request-header field
%     with the `100-continue` expectation if it does not intend to send
%     a request body.
%
% ## Backward compatibility
%
% Because of the presence of older implementations,
%  the protocol allows ambiguous situations in which a client may send
%  `Expect: 100-continue` without receiving either
%  a `417` (Expectation Failed) status or a `100` (Continue) status.
% Therefore, when a client sends this header field to an origin server
%  (possibly via a proxy) from which it has never seen
%  a `100` (Continue) status, the client SHOULD NOT wait for
%  an indefinite period before sending the request body.
/*
Requirements for HTTP/1.1 origin servers:
      - Upon receiving a request which includes an Expect request-header
        field with the "100-continue" expectation, an origin server MUST
        either respond with 100 (Continue) status and continue to read
        from the input stream, or respond with a final status code. The
        origin server MUST NOT wait for the request body before sending
        the 100 (Continue) response. If it responds with a final status
        code, it MAY close the transport connection or it MAY continue
        to read and discard the rest of the request.  It MUST NOT
        perform the requested method if it returns a final status code.
      - An origin server SHOULD NOT send a 100 (Continue) response if
        the request message does not include an Expect request-header
        field with the "100-continue" expectation, and MUST NOT send a
        100 (Continue) response if such a request comes from an HTTP/1.0
        (or earlier) client. There is an exception to this rule: for
        compatibility with RFC 2068, a server MAY send a 100 (Continue)
        status in response to an HTTP/1.1 PUT or POST request that does
        not include an Expect request-header field with the "100-
        continue" expectation. This exception, the purpose of which is
        to minimize any client processing delays associated with an
        undeclared wait for 100 (Continue) status, applies only to
        HTTP/1.1 requests, and not to requests with any other HTTP-
        version value.
      - An origin server MAY omit a 100 (Continue) response if it has
        already received some or all of the request body for the
        corresponding request.
      - An origin server that sends a 100 (Continue) response MUST
        ultimately send a final status code, once the request body is
        received and processed, unless it terminates the transport
        connection prematurely.
      - If an origin server receives a request that does not include an
        Expect request-header field with the "100-continue" expectation,
        the request includes a request body, and the server responds
        with a final status code before reading the entire request body
        from the transport connection, then the server SHOULD NOT close
        the transport connection until it has read the entire request,
        or until the client closes the connection. Otherwise, the client
        might not reliably receive the response message. However, this
        requirement is not be construed as preventing a server from
        defending itself against denial-of-service attacks, or from
        badly broken client implementations.

   Requirements for HTTP/1.1 proxies:
      - If a proxy receives a request that includes an Expect request-
        header field with the "100-continue" expectation, and the proxy
        either knows that the next-hop server complies with HTTP/1.1 or
        higher, or does not know the HTTP version of the next-hop
        server, it MUST forward the request, including the Expect header
        field.
      - If the proxy knows that the version of the next-hop server is
        HTTP/1.0 or lower, it MUST NOT forward the request, and it MUST
        respond with a 417 (Expectation Failed) status.
      - Proxies SHOULD maintain a cache recording the HTTP version
        numbers received from recently-referenced next-hop servers.
      - A proxy MUST NOT forward a 100 (Continue) response if the
        request message was received from an HTTP/1.0 (or earlier)
        client and did not include an Expect request-header field with
        the "100-continue" expectation. This requirement overrides the
        general rule for forwarding of 1xx responses (see section 10.1).
