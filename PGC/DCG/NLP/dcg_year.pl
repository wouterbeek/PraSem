# Preposition intervals

Intervals indicated by prepositions are currently not handled at all.

Some examples include:
  * "before 1907"
  * "after the 17th century"
  * "in the midst of 1780"

The problem is that open intervals like [1] do not normally
have the same meaning as [2] but have a meaning that is
(i) context dependent and (ii) fuzzy. I will treat these separately.

[1] before 1808
~~~

~~~{.html}
[2] from the Big Bang until 1808
~~~

## Context dependency of preposition intervals

The meaning of preposition intervals is (at least in some cases)
context dependent.

For instance, the interval that occurs in the meaning of [3]
is allowed to be bigger than the interval that occurs in the meaning of [4],
where the latter is at least bounded by Einstein's birth year.

~~~{.html}
[3] The first dinosaurs walked the earth before 300 million years B.C.
~~~

~~~{.html}
[4] Einstein came up with the idea of general relativity before 1937
~~~

## Fuzzyness of preposition intervals

The meaning of preposition intervals is (at least in some cases) fuzzy.

For instance, the book mentioned in [5] is (based on the meaning of [5]
solely) more likely to be published in 1924 than in 1901, even though both
are physically possible (given the birth and death years of James Joyce).

[5] James Joyce's Ulyssus was published before 1925.
