<h1 id="barriers">Waiting for the Semantic Web to happen...</h1>

<p>
The Semantic Web has been a great idea since 2001. Unfortunately the use
 of Open and Linked Data is still relatively limited. Individuals and 
institutions depend on big corporations such as Google and Facebook in 
order to maintain their data. This has disadvantages in terms of privacy
 and ownership.</p>

</div>

<p>
The orginal idea of the Semantic Web was to empower people and 
institutions by allowing them to manage their own data. There are three 
reasons why this has not yet happended on a large scale:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Infrastructural &amp; financial barrier </b>Existing Semantic Web deployment systems require a server infrastructure with continuous uptime. </li>
<li><b>Management barrier </b>Once you have your triple store up and running, it is not straightforward how to go about <i>curating</i> and <i>enriching</i> your data.</li>
<li><b>Sharing barrier </b>Once you have an interesting dataset it is 
not easy to share your data with others. Triple stores are often 
accessed via SPARQL endpoints, requiring the user to write complicate 
database-like queries.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="help">So... how can DataHives help?</h1>

<p>
DataHives allows you to curate and share your Linked Open Data </p>

<ol>
<li>... without you having to set up a server.</li>
<li>... without having to be online all of the time (just be online when you want to be)</li>
<li>... without you having to write complicated queries</li>
</ol>

<p>
DataHives puts the original data owner in control by letting her decice</p>
<ul>
<li>... which knowledge is shared with whom.</li>
<li>... what sources are used for dataset enrichment.</li>
</ul>

Local agents (blue dots) traverse the local graph in order to deduce new information (blue arrows) from the graph.</p>

<p>
Remote agents (red dots) travel across graphs. They look for knowledge 
that is related to knowledge that is already present in the home graph 
(red arrows).</p>

<h2>Data publishers</h2>

<p>
By setting up DataHives, a data publisher will automatically enrich her 
curated database with triples that are relevant and trusted. Uptake of 
the DataHives system is made easy by the system not requiring any 
changes to existing Linked Datasets and by the fact that its enrichments
 can be kept separate from the original dataset.</p>

<h2>MSB</h2>

<p>
Small organizations, institutions, and maybe individuals who want to 
maintain their own data but do not have the time, money, or proficiency 
to enrich the data themselves. Such organizations may have data they 
would like to disseminate, but the data in isolation is not interesting 
enough for data consumers. </p>

<h1 id="technology">Technology used</h1>

<p>
DataHives is built using only open and standards-compliant technology 
exclusively. The Web-based user interface is built in JavaScript and 
HTML5. The communication of agents and data is established by following 
the new WebRTC standard for between-browser communication. For data 
format support the W3C standards for triple representation and 
serialization are used (e.g., N-Triples). For calculating the local 
deductive closure the standards-compliant semantics for RDF and RDF 
Schema is used.</p>
