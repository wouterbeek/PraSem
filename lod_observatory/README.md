LOD Observatory
===============

The main purpose of moving from the Web of Documents to the Web of Data
 is that on the latter data is machine-processable,
 whereas the former requires a human agent in order to process its contents.

But the extent to which the exising WoD is indeed machine-navigatable,
 -accessable, and -processable has not been systematically researched yet.

We present a Web Observatory Web Observator that studies the Web
 from the point of view of the machine processor.

We do this by adhering to the five star model of publishing Linked Data.
Our first contribution is that we make this model more explicit
 by augmenting and refining it towards quantifiable criteria.

Secondly, we built an infrastructure of this concretized model
 that allows the various criteria to be quantified over existing datasets.

Thirdly, we analyze a significant snapshot of the WoD
 using this infrastructure and discuss the main problems
 a machine processor encounters.
